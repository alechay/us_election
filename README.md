# us_election
US presidential election data

## Summary
In this repository I did some data exploration and tested my plotly visualizations (see explore.ipynb). I then used that code to create app.py, which contains the source code for a Dash app. The app is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed at https://us-election-app1.herokuapp.com/
